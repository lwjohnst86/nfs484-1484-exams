## Randomized clinical trial

In RCT, babies fed formula have greater IGF1, greater insulin 
secretion, but similar glucose levels to breastfed babies (background,
breastfed babies are leaner).

## Experimental (background, IGF1 increases GLUT4):

Initially, GLUT4 is increased in formula fed non-human animals,
increasing insulin sensitivity (this is actually obversed in humans as
well in LBW babies, but later on there is greater insulin resistance).
However, as animal ages, GLUT4 decreases.

When animals are fed high fat diets, insulin- and contraction-induced
activation of GLUT4 are impaired.

Therefore, formula feeding reduces GLUT4, which increases insulin
resistance (increasing risk for diabetes), and excessive fat intake
(likely because of elevated serum free fatty acids) impair GLUT4
translocation, even with exercise.  But under healthy diet, exercise
increases GLUT4 translocation.

Advice to someone who was not breastfed (thus with lower GLUT4) would
be to maintain a healthy diet and exercise.


**Potential Questions:**

* Given the data so far (table 1), discuss a potential mechanism for the
  differences between formula-fed and breastfed infants (possible
  answer: IGF1 may stimulate secretion of insulin, but glucose is the
  same, so there is likely resistance to insulin, possibly having an
  effect on weight gain)

* Suggest a mechanism why GLUT4 is increased in the formula fed diets
  early after birth, but decrease later in life.  (possible answer:
  not sure, I need to look into it more..)

* Given the information in this assignment, what advise would you give
  to someone who was not breastfed? (Give info on exercise and insulin
  sensitivity?)
