**General Instructions**

1. This is an open book examination; therefore students may use any
   aids that have been brought into the examination room.
   
2. The examination is divided into 2 parts (2 studies) worth 15 marks
   and 25 marks respectively, for a total of 40 marks.  The midterm
   examination will comprise 30% of your final grade.

3. Students must answer all questions in all parts of the examination.
   Please be certain to allocate your time appropriately to ensure
   that you are able to complete all parts of the examination.

4. All answers should be clearly provided in the answer booklets
   provided.  Please provide your answer on the right-hand side of the
   page only.  It will be assumed that the left-hand side of the page
   is used for note making purposes only and material appearing on
   this side of the page will not be read or graded.

5. PLEASE DO NOT WRITE IN PENCIL.  Feel free to cross out anything
   that you want.  Pencil smears and is often difficult to read.
   Thanks for your consideration in this request

**Background**

Dietary fatty acid (FA) intake influences risk for type 2 diabetes
(T2DM), with saturated fatty acid (SFA) and n-3 FA intake associated
with an increased and decreased risk, respectively.  SFA may mediate
their influence on T2DM risk through impairing beta-cell function
(possibly via increased cytosolic fat deposition in the beta-cells,
leading to impaired cytosolic activity and functioning).  A variety of
different mechanisms have been explored to uncover protective effects
of the n-3 FA, with several still under investigation.  Likely
candidates for the effects of SFA and n-3 FA are palmitic acid (PA)
and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), respectively.

There are a number of pathways that could be influenced by dietary FA.
Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) occurs when glucose enters
the pancreatic beta-cell, goes through the glycolytic pathway, and
enters the Kreb Cycle to produce ATP.  The accumulation of
intracellular ATP results in depolarization of the cell membrane and
ultimately releasing insulin into the circulation.

**Study 1 (Value 15/40 marks)**

A randomized controlled trial was conducted to determine the influence
of EPA on glucose control. Forty participants at-risk for T2DM were
put into a control and an experimental group.  Both groups were
instructed to replace the dietary fats they typically use with either
butter (45% SFA, does not contain EPA) or butter supplemented with
EPA, both of which were provided by the researchers, while maintaining
their usual diet for 3 months.  Fasting plasma glucose (FPG),
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; a measure of long term blood glucose), and
C-peptide (C-pep; a protein co-released with insulin and used as a
measure of total insulin secretion) were measured in a fasted state in
the morning at baseline and after the three month treatment (Table 1).
Subjects were given a glucose load and blood was drawn over a 2 hour
period to monitor glucose and insulin levels.  These data were used to
determine the insulin sensitivity index (ISI; a measure of peripheral
(muscle) insulin sensitivity, with higher values indicating better
insulin sensitivity), and glucose and insulin area-under-the-curve
(gAUC and iAUC, respectively) (Table 2).  There were no significant
changes in body weight between groups.

**Questions:**

1. Describe the results from Table 1. (2/40 marks)


2. Based on the data in Table 1, taken under fasting conditions,
   discuss a potential mechanism whereby EPA may decrease the risk of
   T2DM. (4/40 marks)


3. Describe the results in Table 2. (2/40 marks)


4. What was the value of adding a glucose load, compared to just using
   fasting measures, to this experiment?  What additional information
   does the glucose/insulin response to the glucose load provide, in
   terms of mechanisms, as it relates to the impact of EPA on T2DM
   risk? (7/40 marks)

**Study 2 (Value 25/40 marks)**

SFA are proposed to have a lipotoxic effect (which includes impairment
to cytosolic metabolism caused by an accumulation of intracellular FA)
on pancreatic islets, however, it is unknown how this occurs.  An
experimental study using rats was conducted to determine the effect of
PA or EPA on the pancreas and mechanisms underlying glucose-stimulate
insulin secretion (GSIS).  Rats were fed standard chow (control;
contains no PA or EPA), or chow supplemented with PA, EPA, or PA and
EPA (denoted as PA-EPA in the figures) diets for 3 weeks, after which
they were sacrificed to obtain the pancreas.  Pancreatic islets were
then measured for the level of GSIS (Figure 1), triglyceride (TG),
SREBP-1c (transcription factor that initiates lipogenesis), and UCP-2
(uncoupling protein-2; disrupts ATP production in the mitochondria)
content (Figure 2).

**Questions:**

5. Describe the results presented in Figure 1. (2/40 marks)


6. Describe the results shown in Figure 2. (3/40 marks)


7. Using information from the background and Study 2, propose
   mechanism(s) on how PA and EPA may contribute to the regulation of
   insulin secretion within the mitochondria and the cytosol. (6/40 marks)


8. Given the data in Study 2, give 3 examples of additional
   factors/measures the investigators could have considered in Study 1
   to get a better understanding of the role of n-3 FA in T2DM risk.
   Provide a one or two sentence justification for each of these
   factors/measures.  (6/40 marks)


9. Think back to the course assignment regarding the Sandy Lake
   population, where some individuals had a single nucleotide
   polymorphism (SNP) at amino acid 319 (G$\rightarrow$S) in the
   *HNF1A* gene which caused a decrease in pancreatic insulin
   production.  Given the increasing consumption of Western style
   foods that are high in SFA in Sandy Lake, discuss 1) how the
   increase in SFA intake could contribute to T2DM risk and 2) whether
   the return to a traditional diet, including increased consumption
   of fatty fish (which are high in EPA), would impact the risk for
   T2DM.  Be certain to compare and contrast the impact of dietary fat
   in both the GG (wild type) and SS (homozygote for the SNP) groups
   \[you do not need to consider the GS heterzygote group in your
   answer\].  Defend your answer by drawing on data provided in this
   exam. (8/40 marks)
