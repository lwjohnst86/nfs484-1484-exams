## Background: ##

Greater systemic inflammation can disrupt metabolic processes
throughout the body.  Greater inflammation has also been implicated in
the development of plaque buildup in blood vessels, potentially
leading to cardiovascular disease (CVD).  The most common type of CVD
is coronary artery disease (CAD), which can increase the risk for
heart attacks --- also known as myocardial infarctions (MI)

The n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA)
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are
precursors to potent anti-inflammatory molecules.  While EPA and DHA
can be obtained from the diet, we can also synthesize them from the FA
alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).  The n-6 LC-PUFA equivalent of the n-3
LC-PUFA is arachidonic acid (ARA), which can be used in signaling
pro-inflammatory processes.  As with the n-3 LC-PUFA, ARA can be
obtained from the diet as well as synthesized from linoleic acid (LA).
However, both ALA and LA are essential FA and can *only* be obtained
from the diet.  ALA and LA are converted into their longer chain
equivalents (EPA+DHA and ARA, respectively) by the same delta-6
desaturase (D6D) enzyme and therefore compete for its activity.

## Study 1: ##

To observe the role of fatty acids on the risk for CAD, a large
prospective longitudinal cohort was initiated many years ago in order
to record cardiovascular events.  Participants were recruited from
several cities in Canada.  At the baseline visit, participants had
their body mass determined and had blood samples taken.  Blood samples
were analyzed for C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a marker of
systemic inflammation, and were also analyzed for serum FA and D6D
activity.  Every year, participants were called to record any
cardiovascular events that had occurred over the previous year.

After 15 years, the data collected were analyzed.  Relative risks (RR)
were calculated on tertiles of CRP and D6D activity with CAD events.
RR indicate the percent in risk greater CRP or D6D have on CAD events.
A RR is *not* significant if the range crosses the 1.0 value (for
example, a RR of 1.30 with a confidence interval of 0.90 to 1.50 is
considered not significant).

### Questions: ###

1. Describe the results in Table 1.


2. Describe the results in Figure 1.


3. Drawing on information from the Background and the data in Table 1
   and Figure 1, discuss a potential mechanism for how dietary PUFA
   may influence the risk for developing CAD.


## Study 2: ##

There is some public health concern that the ratio of dietary n-6 to
n-3 FA is important for cardiovascular health, particularly in regard
to Western style diets.  Therefore, a community intervention was
conducted over one year in the US to determine the effectiveness of
strategies that aim to reduce dietary n-6 PUFA (indicated as the "Low"
group).  A nearby community with similar characteristics as the
intervention community was used as the control group (indicated as the
"High" group).  A randomly sampled, representative group of
participants from each community were recruited to take part in the
study.  Body mass, dietary intake, and blood samples were collected
from each participant.  Blood samples were used to measure CRP and
serum FA.

The field of nutrigenomics has revealed several candidate genes that
may influence FA metabolism.  These group of alleles, called the
*FADS* gene cluster, has been associated with modulation in D6D
activity.  Therefore, a cheek swab was taken to extract DNA in order
to quantify the gene cluster in the participants, who were then
classified as "Low" if they had <4 *FADS* alleles present and "High"
if they had >4 *FADS* alleles present.

There were no significant differences in BMI and dietary n-3 FA
between the two groups.  However, dietary n-6 did decrease in the
intervention group, suggesting good participation in the intervention.

Abbreviations in the figures represent:

* LL = low n-6 (intervention) and <4 FADS alleles (low)
* LH = low n-6 (intervention) and >4 FADS alleles (high)
* HL = high n-6 (control) and <4 FADS alleles (low)
* HH = high n-6 (control) and >4 FADS alleles (high)

|                         | Low FADS alleles | High FADS alleles |
|-------------------------+------------------+-------------------|
| Serum LA (g/100 g)      | 12.2 (1.54)      | 9.96 (1.10)*      |
| Serum ARA (g/100 g)     | 18.54 (2.08)     | 20.19 (1.98)*     |
| Serum ALA (g/100 g)     | 0.11 (0.02)      | 0.09 (0.01)*      |
| Serum EPA+DHA (g/100 g) | 7.33 (1.45)      | 7.78 (1.23)*      |

Table: Differences between a low number of FADS alleles and a high
number of FADS alleles before the intervention. * indicates
significantly different (p<0.05) from participants with "Low" FADS
alleles.

### Questions: ###

4. Describe the results of Table 2.


5. Using the Background information and the data from Table 2, discuss
   how the *FADS* gene cluster is influencing D6D activity.


6. Describe the results of Figure 2.


7. **Independent** of genotype, was the intervention effective at
   reducing inflammation (using Figure 2)?  Discuss how the
   intervention may influence the risk for CAD.


8. Using **all** information and data up to this point, discuss how
   the *FADS* gene cluster may influence the risk for CAD.


9. Imagine you are clinician and a patient comes in who has has a
   mixed, but predominately East African ancestry.  Considering that
   individuals with African ancestry are more likely to have more
   alleles of the *FADS* gene cluster, use the information and data in
   this exam and using your previous knowledge, how could you reduce
   their risk for CAD disease? Defend your answer by incorporating
   data from both studies.


10. Given that all of these studies were conducted in Western
    countries with a high n-6 to n-3 ratios, discuss how the
    association between higher D6D activity and CAD risk may differ in
    countries with a lower dietary n-6 to n-3 ratio (for example, in
    Inuits consuming a traditional diet).  Explain any neutral or
    positive influences the *FADS* alleles may have.  Defend your
    answer using your own knowledge, the Background information and
    the two studies.


11. A recent large randomized, controlled clinical trial showed no
    effect of n-3 LC-PUFA supplementation on myocardial infarction (a
    common outcome of CAD).  Comment on 1) some reasons why
    improvements in dietary lipids may not translate to reductions in
    heart attack, 2) why a clinical trial may not always be able to
    identify effects with a supplementation in the general population,
    and 3) why targeting only n-3 LC-PUFA may not always be effective.
    Use your previous knowledge and all the information and data from
    this exam.
