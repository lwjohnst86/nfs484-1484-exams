Maybe instead of African + SFA intake with CVD, we look at how the
role of SFA vs carbs on lipoprotein size and atherogenicity?

BUT: There is the *FADS* gene which about 80% of African Americans
carry two copies of the gene (associated with increased levels of
arachidonic acid) compared to about 45% in European Americans.

*FADS* gene and LDL

ALA -> d5d (FADS1) and d6d (FADS2) -> DHA
LA -> d5d and d6d -> AA

Greater AA associated with greater eicosanoid -> inflammation, greater
risk for MI

Greater risk alleles for FADS -> greater CRP, CAD risk

Greater d5d and d6d toward AA increase risk for CAD

Combination of **both** FADS gene + dietary intake is important

rs174548 in FADS1 may influence cholesterol metabolism

Good figures/tables in Martinelli2008

Background:



Study 1:

Role of LC-PUFA on CVD risk. Highlight ethnic differences.
Inflammation and cholesterol metabolism.

Final question (?)

Using your previous knowledge: Given a recent clinical trial that
showed no effect of LC-PUFA on myocardial infarction, comment on 1)
some reasons why improvements in lipid metabolisms may not translate
to reductions in heart attack and 2) why a clinical trial may not
always be able to pick up causal mechanisms even if they may be
present in a subset of the population (eg. FADS polymorphism).
