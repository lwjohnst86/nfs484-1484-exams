# Ideas/notes for the final #

Maybe instead of African + SFA intake with CVD, we look at how the
role of SFA vs carbs on lipoprotein size and atherogenicity?

BUT: There is the *FADS* gene which about 80% of African Americans
carry two copies of the gene (associated with increased levels of
arachidonic acid) compared to about 45% in European Americans.

*FADS* gene and LDL

ALA -> d5d (FADS1) and d6d (FADS2) -> DHA
LA -> d5d and d6d -> AA


Greater d5d and d6d toward AA increase risk for CAD

Combination of **both** FADS gene + dietary intake is important

rs174548 in FADS1 may influence cholesterol metabolism

Individuals with CAD had lower levels of LA than controls.  So even
though it has a greater inflammatory properties, it is still
essential (for arterial stiffness).  Combined with higher d6d + d5d activity.

Combination of higher LA intake, lower ALA intake, and greater d6d
activity (eg. more risk alleles on the FADS gene cluster) is the worst
case.

Even though greater d9d and elongase contribute to more ARA *and*
EPA+DHA, there are vastly greater levels of both LA in the diet + more
ARA. So the protective effect of EPA+DHA is offset by the higher
levels of LA+ARA. (Martinelli)

# (Very) rough draft of final #

## Background: ##

Greater systemic inflammation can disrupt multiple organs including
the adipocytes, potentially leading to an increased release of stored
free fatty acids (FA), as well as discruption lipid and cholesterol
metabolism.  Lipids and cholesterol are packaged in the liver into
very-low density lipoproteins (VLDL) and low density lipoproteins
(LDL).  Higher levels of circulating LDL may eventually penetrate the
blood vessels, building up plaque and leading to cardiovascular
disease (CVD).  The most common type of CVD is coronary artery disease
(CAD), which can increase the risk for heart attacks --- also known as
myocardial infarctions (MI)

The n-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LC-PUFA)
eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are
precursors to potent anti-inflammatory molecules and may favourably
modify serum lipoprotein composition.  While EPA and DHA can be
obtained from the diet, we can also synthesize them from the FA
alpha-linolenic acid (ALA).  The n-6 LC-PUFA equivalent of the n-3
LC-PUFA is arachidonic acid (ARA) and is the precursor to potent
pro-inflammatory molecules.  As with the n-3 LC-PUFA, ARA can be
obtained from the diet as well as synthesized from linoleic acid (LA).
Both ALA and LA are essential FA and can *only* be obtained from the
diet.  ALA and LA are converted into their longer chain equivalents by
the same delta-6 desaturase (D6D) enzyme and so compete for its
action.

## Study 1: ##

Prospective longitudinal cohort.  Cross-sectional detail on
inflammation, serum and dietary levels of the LC-PUFA.  Prospective
data on CAD events.

The RR... (if it ranges between less than 1.0 and greater than 1.0
there is no significant difference; for example, a CI of 0.98 to 1.15
is not significant).

Study 1 data (fig/tab): non-CAD vs future CAD and CRP, plasma and
dietary n-6 and n-3 PUFA, and percentage of subjects of European and
African descent at the baseline visit.

Table is showing that:
* Future CAD subjects at baseline had (compared to non-CAD):
    - = European descent
    - > African descent
    - > serum ARA
    - < serum LA
    - < ALA
    - > EPA + DHA
    - > CRP
    - > diet of n-6
    - = diet n-3

Study 1 data (fig/tab): RR of tertiles of D6D, CRP, and ARA/EPA+DHA
with CAD.

Fig showing that:
* D6D inc risk
* ARA/EPA+DHA ratio inc risk
* CRP inc risk

### What we want them to get at: ###

We want them to highlight that:
* There are possible genetic differences
* Inflammation contributes to CAD
* Higher intake of n-6 may be bad
* Greater ARA relative to EPA+DHA is bad
* Greater D6D is bad
* That paradoxically LA and ALA is lower in those who will develop CAD
* And that paradoxically EPA is also higher
* Higher intakes of n-6 appear bad, but no influence of n-3

## Study 2: ##

A community intervention was conducted to determine the effectiveness
of strategies that aim to reduce dietary n-6 PUFA.

Higher levels of triacylglycerol (TAG) are thought to contribute to
the development of cardiovascular diseases such as CAD.  TAG is
produced in the liver from free fatty acids and packed into
lipoprotein to be sent into the blood.  TAG may directly contribute to
CAD or may be a symptom of dysfunction of other organs.

Greater risk alleles for FADS -> greater CRP, CAD risk
Interaction between FADS gene and LC-PUFA intake on cholesterol +
inflammation on CAD.

Dietary intake of LA and ALA is thought to be best around a 1-to-1
ratio.  The current Western diet is approximately 20-30-to-1 ratio
(greater levels of LA).

Greater FADS allele (enhanced LC-PUFA synthesis) with greater
genetic components of African ancestry.

Table showing basic characteristics (like diet, participation?, serum
ARA and ARA/EPA+DHA) before and after intervention?.
* Showing that the non-intervention group has a higher level of n-6
  intake

Table showing differences between low FADS gene alleles and high
number of FADS gene allele before intervention:
* Those with more FADS alleles have:
    - > n-3 LC-PUFA (EPA+DHA)
    - > ARA
    - < LA
    - < ALA
    - = dietary n-3 and n-6

Fig: Showing overall intervention on CRP and TAG
- Intervention reduces ARA/n-3 LC-PUFA ratio, CRP and TAG compared to
  non-intervention

Fig: Showing intervention according to number of FADS gene alleles
(use Cormier et al 2012 for fig to edit).

- Showing four bars: Low FADS + intervention, low FADS + no
  intervention, high FADS + intervention, high FADS + no intervention
- Results show that low fads + intervention is lower than no
  intervention, but that high FADS + intervention has a bigger
  difference to no intervention on: ARA-to-n3 LC-PUFA ratio, CRP, and
  TAG

### What we want them to get at: ###

We want them to highlight that:
* More FADS alleles greater ARA and EPA+DHA
* More FADS greater CRP
* More FADS + greater intake of n-6 = inc CRP, ARA, and TAG
* Lower intake of n-6 reduces CRP, ARA, and TAG
* While paradoxical, the higher EPA+DHA in the FADS group is not
  enough to offset the higher levels of LA.
* Greater LA competes for the D6D enzyme and too much LA reduces
  production of EPA+DHA, favouring ARA.

## Possible questions: ##

Discuss why TAG might be higher in the high FADS + high n-6 intake
group.  Use the Background, Study 1, and Study 2 to defend your
answer.

Discuss the potential mechanisms underlying Study 2

Given the role that inflammation (CRP) and elevated serum lipids (TAG)
play in CAD, comment on the risk for CAD that the intervention
community may have compared to the non-intervention community.  What
are some factors that may influence the results of Study 2, given that
it is a community intervention?

Imagine you are clinician and a patient comes in who has has a mixed,
but predominately East African ancestry.  Given that individuals with
African ancestry are more likely to have more alleles of the FADS gene
cluster, given the data and your past knowledge, how could you reduce
their risk for CAD disease? Defend your answer using *only* the data
from both studies.

Final question (?)

Using your previous knowledge and all the data from this final: A
recent clinical trial showed no effect of n-3 LC-PUFA on myocardial
infarction (a common outcome of CAD), comment on 1) some reasons why
improvements in dietary lipids may not translate to reductions in
heart attack, 2) why a clinical trial may not always be able to
pick up causal mechanisms in the general population, even though a
causal effect may actually be present in a subset of the population
(for example, FADS polymorphisms), and 3) why targeting only n-3
LC-PUFA may not always be effective.
